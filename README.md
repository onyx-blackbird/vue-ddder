## Features
- With the initial version you can place notes on a grid.
- You can move and resize the notes.
- You can draw arrows between two notes.
- This "layout" can be exported as JSON and imported again, as there is currently no persistence.
- You can export a glossary based on the notes title and description as either JSON or Markdown.

## Roadmap
This version is still a beta and may have a few bugs. The goal is to add additional features over time.

### UML Screen
- A second screen where the actual models can be defined in an UML like manner.
- Allow to annotate arrows.
