# Domain Driven Designer

This webbased app can help to digitalize event storming outcomes. 

## Changelog
The initial version can only place cards on a grid and resize them and draw arrows in between (only from left to right).
This "layout" can be exported as JSON and imported again, as there is currently no persistence.

## Roadmap
The current version doesn't offer much, but there are plans to add many features.

### Event Storm Screen
- Export the glossary to either JSON or Markdown

### UML Screen
- A second screen where the actual models can be defined in an UML like manner.
- Annotade arrows
