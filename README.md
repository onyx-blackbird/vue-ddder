## Changelog
The initial version can only place cards on a grid and resize them and draw arrows in between (only from left to right).
This "layout" can be exported as JSON and imported again, as there is currently no persistence.

## Roadmap
This version is still a beta and may have a few bugs. The goal is to add additional features over time.

### UML Screen
- A second screen where the actual models can be defined in an UML like manner.
- Allow to annotate arrows
