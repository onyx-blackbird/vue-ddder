## Features
- Choose from the different types of notes and place them on a grid.
- Move and resize notes.
- Change the title and add a description (for multiple languages)
- Draw arrows between two notes.
- This "layout" can be exported as JSON and imported again, as there is currently no persistence.
- Export a glossary based on the notes title and description as either JSON or Markdown.
- Display the glossary as a table and edit the titles and descriptions.

## Roadmap
This version is still a beta and may have a few bugs. The goal is to add additional features over time.

### UML Screen
- Additional screen where the actual models can be defined in an UML like manner.
- Allow to annotate arrows.
