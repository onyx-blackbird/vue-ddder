# Domain Driven Designer

This webbased app can help to digitalize event storming outcomes. 

## Changelog
The initial version can only place cards on a grid and resize them. This "layout" can be exported and imported again, as there is currently no persistence.

## Roadmap
The current version doesn't offer much, but there are plans to add many features.

### Event Storm Screen
- lines/arrows between cards (currently only works for horizontal line)
- Descriptions for the titles to build an ubiquitous language
- Export the glossary to either JSON or Markdown

### Model Screen
- A second screen where the actual models can be defined in an UML like manner.
